# Deploy from Dashboard

1. Navigate to the Textbase [dashboard](https://textbase-dashboard-nextjs.vercel.app/).
2. Sign in using your google account.
3. Click on `Create Deployment` and then click on `Create Bot` on the top right.
4. You will need to provide a chatbot name and you need to upload the zip file. **IMPORTANT:** The bot name can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
5. Click on `Create Bot` to start the deployment.
6. This will redirect you to the `Deployments` section after a few seconds. In here, you can check the status of your bot and if it's deployed successfully, a link will be generated. You can click on the blue button with the symbol: `</>` which will redirect to the link where the bot is deployed and you can test it out!
